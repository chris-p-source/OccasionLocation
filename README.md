# WhereCanWeGo
Bachelors dissertation project

This is my dissertation project for my bachelors degree. 
A website designed for users to be able to register an account, sign in and search for events happening within their local area. 
They are able to search via name, date and location.
Once an event has been selected by a user they are able to view a details page in which they are able to sign up. 
They are also able to engage in a messages thread with the host of the event.
Users are also able to add their own events to the website.
Project is built with a Python and Django backend with a HTML, CSS and JavaScript frontend.

Project last updated April 2021.
