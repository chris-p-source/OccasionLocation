# WhereCanWeGo
Bachelors Dissertation Project @ University of Westminster

This is my dissertation project for my bachelors degree. A website designed for users to be able to search for events happening within their local area. 

Project is built with a Python and Django backend with a HTML, CSS and JavaScript frontend.

#Core features:  
• Users are able to register and log in.  
• Users are able to search for events via name, date and location.  
• Users are able to view a details page about each event in which they are able to sign up for it.
